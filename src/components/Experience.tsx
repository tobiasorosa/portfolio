							My first experience as a developer was in a company holding the
							best cultural way of dealing with work as possible, a flexible
							work-shift, with focus on deliverying the job rather than
							completing a fixed amount of time daily, was a great way of
							starting my career. iDinheiro is still growing, with a lot of
							great professionals I believe they will achieve what them are
							aiming for: Help the brazilian citizens to make better financial
							decisions. There, I was able to deliver a lot of good features,
							such as financial calculators that could help users in real life
							situations. I helped making the pages load faster, searching for
							the best alternatives technically. The development was very
							focused on SEO, aiming for the best ranking on Google. During this
							time, I learned Next.js, Nest.js, a lot of typescript, AWS and
							even Wordpress, messing around with some PHP functions as well.
							But after some time, I felt that a next step was needed, something
							more complex and ambitious.

						<p className='mx-5 text-sm'>
							Being part of the development and support of a large scale app,
							the Hashcoop product, used as a back-office by big union credits,
							with hundreds of thousands cooperative members, has been a big
							challenge and everyday I am learning something new. But it was
							quickly for me to begin contributing to the team positively,
							specially when it came to other projects, including legacy apps,
							written in Durandal. Most of my job here is based in expanding and
							creating new features in the hashcoop, a web app developed with
							Angular and .NET Core. At Threeo, I have senior devs with a lot of
							experience and knowledge regarding good practices, clean code,
							design patterns and great programming logic, things I value the
							most for my professional growth in the area.
